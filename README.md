Introduction

Sorting algorithms are algorithms that arrange elements in a specific order, typically ascending or descending, based on a specified comparison criterion. These algorithms are essential in various computer science applications, including searching, data analysis, and optimization.

This repository provides implementations of popular sorting algorithms, including:

Bubble sort
Selection sort
Insertion sort
Merge sort
Quick sort
Heap sort
And more!
Each sorting algorithm is implemented in C and accompanied by explanations and comments to aid understanding.
